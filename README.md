# PartialInvitesCore - NetCore 2

## Simple Data Entry Application
Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Yearâ€™s Eve party and that she/he has asked me to create a web
app that allows his/her invitees to electronically RSVP. She/He has asked for these four key features:
1. A home page that shows information about the party
2. A form that can be used to RSVP
3. Validation for the RSVP form, which will display a thank-you page
4. A summary page that shows who is coming to the party
